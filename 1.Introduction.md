# Mastering Nmap: The Power of Enumeration*
When it comes to hacking, *knowledge is power. The more you know about a target system or network, the more options you have for successful penetration. This delves into **enumeration and port scanning* using *Nmap*, the industry-standard tool for network reconnaissance.

---

##  *Why Enumeration Matters*
Before exploitation, understanding the target is crucial. Enumeration helps you:
- Discover *open ports* and services running on the target.
- Identify critical systems like *web servers* or *Active Directory Domain Controllers*.
- Create a "map" of the target landscape to strategize your attacks effectively.

##  *Port Scanning with Nmap*
*Nmap* is a powerful tool designed to:
1. *Identify open, closed, and filtered ports* on a target.
2. Enumerate the *services running on each port*.
3. Perform *vulnerability scans* and, in some cases, even execute exploits through its scripting engine.

###  *Why Nmap?*
- *Industry Standard*: Nmap is unmatched in functionality and versatility.
- *Scripting Engine*: Automate scans, find vulnerabilities, and even exploit them directly.
- *Flexible Scanning Options*: From basic scans to advanced techniques.
- *Port Scanning*: Discover open, closed, or filtered ports.
- *Service Enumeration*: Identify services running on each port.
- *Firewall Evasion*: Bypass network defenses with advanced techniques.

## *Key Concepts*

###  *Port Scanning Basics*
- *What is Port Scanning?*  
  It involves checking each port on a target to determine if it is open, closed, or filtered.  
- *Why Perform Port Scanning?*  
  Without knowing the open ports, successful exploitation is nearly impossible.

### *Types of Ports*
- *Standard Ports*: Commonly used for specific services.
  - *80*: HTTP Webservice
  - *443*: HTTPS Webservice
  - *445*: SMB
  - *139*: NETBIOS  
- *Custom Ports*: Often seen in Capture the Flag (CTF) events where standard ports may be altered.
