The **Nmap Scripting Engine (NSE)** is a powerful tool that extends Nmap's functionality, enabling tasks from vulnerability scanning to exploitation. Understanding how to find and manage these scripts is essential for efficient use. Here's a guide on finding, searching, and installing NSE scripts.

---

##  Finding NSE Scripts

###  **Official Script List**
Nmap maintains a comprehensive list of scripts on its website. Visit it for:
- A complete directory of **official scripts**.
- Categories and descriptions for each script.  

 [Nmap Official Scripts](https://nmap.org/nsedoc/)

###  **Local Storage**
On Linux, NSE scripts are stored at:  
```
/usr/share/nmap/scripts
```

---

##  Searching for Scripts

###  Method 1: Using script.db
Nmap uses `/usr/share/nmap/scripts/script.db` to track available scripts. This formatted text file maps scripts to categories.

**Search Example**:
```
grep "ftp" /usr/share/nmap/scripts/script.db
```
This searches for all scripts related to FTP.

###  Method 2: Using ls
Use the ls command with wildcards (*) to find scripts.

**Search Example**:
```
ls -l /usr/share/nmap/scripts/*ftp*
```
Finds all scripts with "ftp" in their names.

###  Search for Categories:
For instance, finding all safe scripts:

```
grep "safe" /usr/share/nmap/scripts/script.db
```

##  Installing New Scripts

###  Using apt
Keep your scripts updated with:

```
sudo apt update && sudo apt install nmap
```

---

##  Manual Installation
To install a script manually:

1. Download the Script:
```
sudo wget -O /usr/share/nmap/scripts/<script-name>.nse https://svn.nmap.org/nmap/scripts/<script-name>.nse
```

2. Update the script.db File:
```
nmap --script-updatedb
```

** Make Your Own Scripts**:
Want to write your custom NSE scripts? Basic Lua knowledge is enough!
